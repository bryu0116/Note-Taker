## Usage
AS A user, I want to be able to write and save notes. I WANT to be able to delete notes I've written before. SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete.

In a business context, it's for users that need to keep track of a lot of information, it's easy to forget or be unable to recall something important. Being able to take persistent notes allows users to have written information available when needed.
